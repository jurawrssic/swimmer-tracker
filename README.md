##THIS IS IN PROGRESS - as a swimmer, I wanted somewhere to track my progress throughout the weeks so I started this project which is far from being finished.

TODO: 
- add i18n;
- add d3.js for better view of progress;
- refact code;
- add a backend;

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
